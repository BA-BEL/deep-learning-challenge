# deep-learning-challenge
Module 21 Challenge

This repository contains an ML model facilitated through deep learning modules (TensorFlow). The model attempts to predict if firms are successful enough to fund.


`deep-learning.ipynb` contains code used for data sourcing, preprocessing, and modeling.

* Report on this can be found in `report.md` in the root directory also.


Note: Run `deep-learning.ipynb` with Google colab if code is not edited.
